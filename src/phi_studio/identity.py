"""Which physical arm is on which port.

Two independent signals, because neither is enough alone:

  * USB adapter serial. Survives a change of socket, reboot, or Mac, where the
    /dev path does not (the 2026-08-06 port swap drove the leader as a follower).
    It names the adapter, not the arm, so a board moved to another arm lies.
  * Calibration registers. LeRobot writes Homing_Offset and Min/Max_Position_Limit
    into every servo at calibration and compares them with the file on connect
    (lerobot/motors/feetech/feetech.py:226-245). Read back with torque untouched,
    they name the calibration file the arm was last calibrated with.

Pure data in, data out: no serial I/O and no LeRobot import, so CI can test it.
