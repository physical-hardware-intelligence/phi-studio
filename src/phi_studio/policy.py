"""Policies the worker can run on the followers in place of the leader arms.

A policy takes the followers' present joint positions and returns a chunk of goal positions, one
per control tick, which the worker plays out before asking for the next chunk. The worker clips
every goal exactly as it clips teleop goals.

Only the scripted mock policy runs today. Real checkpoints (ACT, pi0.5) need the hardware backend
and inference on its own thread: a forward pass that takes longer than one control period would
stall the bus loop and its heartbeat watchdog if it ran inline. The catalog lists them as
unavailable and says why, rather than hiding them.
